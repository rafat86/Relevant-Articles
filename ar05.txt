HOW AMERICAN POLITICS WENT INSANE

By Jonathan Rauch
JULY/AUGUST 2016 ISSUE

As the presidential primaries unfold, Kanye West is leading a fractured field of Democrats. The Republican 
front-runner is Phil Robertson, of Duck Dynasty fame. Elected governor of Louisiana only a few months ago, 
he is promising to defy the Washington establishment by never trimming his beard. Party elders have given up 
all pretense of being more than spectators, and most of the candidates have given up all pretense of party 
loyalty. On the debate stages, and everywhere else, anything goes.

I could continue, but you get the gist. Yes, the political future I have described is unreal. 
But it is also a linear extrapolation of several trends on vivid display right now. Astonishingly, 
the 2016 Republican presidential race has been dominated by a candidate who is not, in any meaningful 
sense, a Republican. According to registration records, since 1987 Donald Trump has been a Republican, 
then an independent, then a Democrat, then a Republican, then â€œI do not wish to enroll in a party, then a 
Republican; he has donated to both parties; he has shown loyalty to and affinity for neither. The second-place 
candidate, Republican Senator Ted Cruz, built his brand by tearing down his party: slurring the Senate 
Republican leader, railing against the Republican establishment, and closing the government as a career move.

The Republicans noisy breakdown has been echoed eerily, albeit less loudly, on the Democratic side, where, 
after the early primaries, one of the two remaining contestants for the nomination was not, in any meaningful 
sense, a Democrat. Senator Bernie Sanders was an independent who switched to nominal Democratic affiliation on 
the day he filed for the New Hampshire primary, only three months before that election. He surged into second 
place by winning independents while losing Democrats. If it had been up to Democrats to choose their partys 
nominee, Sanders bid would have collapsed after Super Tuesday. In their various ways, Trump, Cruz, and Sanders 
are demonstrating a new principle: The political parties no longer have either intelligible boundaries or 
enforceable norms, and, as a result, renegade political behavior pays.
